        <h3>My name is Michel Helal Jr, born and raised in New Jersey. Birthday Jan 2,1999. I am living in Brazil and studying how to program because I really want to
            live in Brazil with a remote job. My last update was a couple days ago. </h5>

        <h5>Fist thing I have to do after waking up, is drink half a bottle of water. I go to soccer practice
            and I help my grandfather get down the stairs to go for his moring stroll. Then I eat and study. i do like hitting the gym after a long period of studying. Then I chow down so food and either get back to work or relax. </h5>

        <h2>Hike Day</h2>
        <h5> On this paticular day me and my father with his girlfriend
            went on a hoke bery early in the morning. So early I decided that 
            I would stay up all night till 3 oclock in the morning. When we get to the meet up 
            location I realized I had been there before with my girlfriend. What I didn't know is that we 
            can get to Christ the Redeemer from there. On the way up with were acompanied by a group of people 
            as well. Many poeple were from Europe, which was pretty neat to hear a variety of languages being spoken.
            The hike took an hour and a half to get to the top. We took pictures and ate the last bits of food we had in
            the bag. After the pictures, and a moment of gratitude for life and the view, we made our way back down. On our way
            down we made a pit stop at a waterfall, which topped off the hike. All I can say after all that is don't forget to bring your bug repellant.
